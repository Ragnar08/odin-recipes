    <h3>Masala dosa are crispy, soft, savory and healthy crepes made with a rice and lentil batter. The dosa are gluten-free and dairy-free, with a sturdy yet soft texture that’s great for holding a hearty homemade potato filling.</h3>
    <p>To make the batter, lentils and rice are soaked for several hours and then blended together. This makes a creamy and smooth batter. This rice and lentil batter is fermented overnight to create just the right tangy flavor and tender, light crepes.
    </p>
    <p>Dosa Batter is quickly cooked like a thin pancake on a hot griddle, with your choice of oil or butter or ghee. The crepe is then filled with a spiced potato and onion filling, and served with Sambar and Coconut Chutney.
    </p>   
    <p>You can easily customize this recipe to fit your tastes by adding grated paneer, cheese, extra veggies (like peas, carrots, cauliflower, and/or green beans) to the potato filling, and serving with other favorite dipping sauces or side dishes.</p>
